					<p>The City of London has decided to organise and host an event for students from different universities within the city.</p>
					
					<p>In this event, students can chose to walk, cycle or run the 10 mile route that has been chosen by the city, this route is based on the same route as the London Marathon. </p>
					
					<p> There will have regular checkpoints along the route, so that if a student cannot walk for any longer, they will be able to simply drop out of marathon at those checkpoints. Students also have a choice of attending this event individually or in groups.</p>
					
					<p>This event is done with the partnership with Adidas and will be held on the 28th of June 2020.</p>

						<p>Currently students carry lot of responsibilities on themselves: they are attending classes, attending extracurricular activities, studying, preparing for exams, balancing their social life and working part time jobs.</p>
						
						<p>Students can easily become stressed from the amount of work that they have to do, which can affect their mental health and wellbeing. When a student is stressed, they might find difficulties in focusing on tasks, irritated and be anxious about things.</p>
						
						<p>If a student is stressed for a long period of time they might become depressed. This is why students need a way to release that stress and just relax.</p>
					
					</div>
					
				</div>
				
				<div id="aim2">
				
					<div id="aim2-left">
					
						<p>This event was organised so that students can relax from their responsibilities and socialise with other students whilst exercising, which can be beneficial for their physical and mental health.</p>
						
						<p>It is also a good way for new students who are considering studying in London to get familiar with the city.</p>
						
						<p>This event was made so that it would encourage students to take part in physical exercise more often and to try to get these students interested in doing other sports.</p>

				<h2> Adidas - Our Partner </h2>
				
				<p>We want to be the best sports company in the world. What does that mean? Well, to us ‘best’ means that we design, build and sell the best sports products in the world, with the best service and experience, and that we do so in a sustainable way. But ‘best’ is also what our consumers, athletes, teams, partners, media and shareholders say about us.</p>
				<p>Everything we do is rooted in sport. The good news is that sport plays an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, on and off the field of play, so we operate in a highly attractive industry. We push the boundaries of products, experiences and services to drive brand desire and capitalize on the growth opportunities in sport as well as in sports-inspired casual and activewear. However, the importance of sport goes far beyond that. Sport is central to every culture and society and is core to an individual’s health and happiness. Therefore, we believe that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. And we work every day to inspire and enable people to harness the power of sport in their lives.</p>
